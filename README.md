# Random-Password-Generator

The scope of this project is to create a program that would generate a random strong password based on the user's instructions. This program was created in Python using the PyCharm IDE. The user has the ability to decide the number of characters in their password along with the number of letters, digits and special characters in their custom password. This application has been tested to consider all extreme test cases to ensure proper functioning.
